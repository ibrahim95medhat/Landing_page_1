        <section id="cl1"class="sec"><br><h3>section1</h3><p>Television is one of the many wonders of modern science and technology. It was invented in England by the Scottish scientist J.N. Baird in 1928 and the British Broadcasting Corporation was the first to broadcast television images in 1929. Previously the radio helped us hear things from far and near. spread information and knowledge from one corner of the globe to another. But all this was done through sound only. But television combined visual images with sound. Today we can watch games, shows, and song and dance programs from all corners of the world while sitting at our own homes. TV can be used for educating the masses, for bringing to us the latest pieces of information audio-visually and can provide us all kinds of entertainment even in color. But as in all things, too much televiewing may prove harmful. In many cases, the habit of watching TV has an adverse effect on the study habits of the young. When we read books, we have to use our intelligence and imagination. But in most cases, TV watching is a passive thing. It may dull our imagination and intelligence.

        <section id="cl2"class="sec"><br><h3>section2</h3><p>Modern civilization is based upon the use of machines. For doing their workday in and day out the machines need a constant supply of energy without which they would come to a halt. Our transport systems-diesel-run railways, steamships, motor vehicles, aeroplanes-all constantly need natural fuel to keep on moving. In the last three hundred years, much of human efforts have been spent in search of the sources of energy-coal, petroleum, and power generated from water–which will maintain the present rhythm of civilization unchecked. Not only that; as the population of the world increases, the need for energy will also increase. But there is the real fear that the world reserves for energy sources of petroleum, coal, and hydel-power are gradually being exhausted. That is why new and unconventional sources of energy like nuclear and solar energy need to be developed. While the advanced countries in America and Europe have the wealth and scientific know-how to produce solar and nuclear energy on a commercial scale, the poorer Asiatic countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh may develop an energy source by bio-gas-developing machines. But the point is that researches in the field of development of new energy sources must be carried on further and expedited so that the exhaustion of the conventional sources of power does not adversely affect the growth of our economy and progress of civilization.</p></section>
        <section id="cl3"class="sec"><br><h3>section3</h3><p>Tobacco was first discovered in America. Its cultivation on a wide scale with the help of negro-slaves made it one of the major export items in the American economy. Other parts of the world like Burma and Cuba also cultivated tobacco. Cigarettes made of tobacco rolled in tissue paper helped spread a very harmful habit among the so-called advanced countries of the West. From there it spread to different other countries of the world. Attractive packaging and expert publicity helped spread the addiction of smoking cigarettes even among the poorer sections of the people. But recently it has been detected that the habit of smoking causes different kinds of serious physical ailments, beginning with coughing, sore throat, laryngitis, asthma, and ending with such a fatal disease as cancer. Besides, for no fault of their own even persons who are liable to inhale the cigarette smoke when in the company of a smoker may suffer from any of these diseases. This shows how dangerous the habit of smoking cigarettes is. Besides, smoking cigarettes means a waste of money, since the habit instead of doing any good only causes injury to one’s health and makes one a slave to the addiction. It has been found that by abstaining from smoking a person may be cured of many diseases. He is also relieved of the burden of needless expenses and ultimately becomes a happier and healthier citizen. Therefore, we should all steer clear of this bad habit of smoking cigarettes.</p></section>
        <section id="cl4"class="sec"><br><h3>section4</h3><p>The computer is one of the marvels of modern science. Its origin may be traced to the mechanical calculating machine that was invented by Charles Babbage, an English mathematician, in 1834. The machine could not fully realize the purpose that Babbage had in mind, because of the inadequate engineering skill of the time. Today’s computers are electronic. A computer can work very fast because it runs on a small current of electricity that flows at a very high speed. With the help of stored information and data, it can do calculations of very large figures within a very short time. Within seconds a computer can add, subtract, multiply and divide very large figures. Such calculations would take even an expert mathematician a much longer time to complete. Today computers are used widely in all advanced countries in data processing which means compilation, correlation, and selection of facts. In all fields of research and industry and business, the use of computers is constantly on the rise. There are two types of computers: digital and analog. The first processes information numerically, the latter provides information in terms of quantity rather than by numerical counting. But computers can do their work only when a series of clearly defined information is fed into them, which is known as programming. For this a specialized programming language is necessary. The benefits of computers are many. They economize time, speed up work, save labor and in the long run reduce costs. In all advanced countries, they are used in educational institutions, industries, research laboratories. government departments and so on. In space research, they are of great importance. In India computers are gradually being introduced to facilitate work in different fields, but not to the required extent. There is strong opposition to the wider introduction of its use because many employees in private and public sectors fear that the use of computers may lead to large-scale unemployment in a country that is already plagued by this problem.</p></section>
